# LAGraph

Hopefully, **LAGraph** will soon be a **SparkPackages** project! When that happens, please see the [LAGraph SparkPackages homepage](https://spark-packages.org/?q=tags%3A%22Graph%22) website for more information. The latest project documentation can be found at the
[**LAGraph Documentation**](https://ibm.github.io/lagraph/) website on GitHub.

LAGraph is a Scala package that supports the implementation of scalable graph algorithms using algebraic techniques.
Its distinguishing characteristics are:

  1. **Support for both conventional and custom semirings**
  1. **Support for both primitive and custom types**
  1. **Multiple execution modes**, including Spark and pure Scala.
  1. **Automatic optimization** based on data and cluster characteristics to ensure both efficiency and scalability.


LAGraph is evolving, while several
classical algorithms have been implemented on top of LAGraph, the
completeness of interface has not been established.

## Download & Setup

For a first pass, instead of performing a full Spark install, you
might consider working through the
[LAGraph Quick Start (using Zeppelin)](https://ibm.github.io/lagraph#quick-start).
